# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This repository is a Boostrap version of the mobile responsive portfolio assignment, which can be found [here](https://github.com/bking1989/Responsive-Portfolio).

The HTML and CSS between these two assignments and repositories are very similar. However, this repository is for a version of the website that was made entirely in Bootstrap, rather than hand-coding everything using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery included). A major difference is that there is very little actual CSS, as everything is stylized using Bootstrap's default stylesheet and various `class` types.
